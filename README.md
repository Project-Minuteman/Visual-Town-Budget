Budget Visualization Framework
========
![screenshot](https://raw.github.com/goinvo/Visual-Town-Budget/develop/docs/img/example_screenshot.png)
Open-source budget visualization framework.

## Requirements
* PHP-enabled webserver
* SCSS compiler

## Setup
Clone this repository to your local machine and point your webserver root to `src/httpdocs`, the application should work out of the box, this repository contains some sample data that can be used for testing.

## Localized Variables  
Set the variables in the `localized_variables.php` file to your municipality's information. These are global variables used throughout the Visual Budget instance. The file can be found in `/src/httpdocs/includes`.  

## Components
#### Cards
Report statical information about selected entry (`src/httpdocs/js/cards.js`).

![card-img](https://raw.github.com/goinvo/Visual-Town-Budget/develop/docs/img/cards.png)

#### Chart
Shows data change over time (`src/httpdocs/js/chart.js`).

![chart-img](https://raw.github.com/goinvo/Visual-Town-Budget/develop/docs/img/chart.png)


#### Treemap
Used as the main navigation component (`src/httpdocs/js/treemap.js`).

#### Table
Alternative navigation technique to a treemap (`src/httpdocs/js/tables.js`).

#### Component Interface
Each component implements a common interface of 3 calls:

* `Initialize`: called only once, prepares the component to show data
* `Open`: opens a data object and displays its contents using the specified component
* `Update`: refreshes component data (useful when year changes and new values need to be plotted)

## Directory Structure
* **/config**: Compass configuration files
* **/src/httpdocs**: Application root directory
   *  **css**: compiled SCSS and libraries (bootstrap, introJs)
   *  **data**: CSV and JSON data files
      *  **processing**:   temporary directory for data conversion
         *  `processCSV.py`: converts CSV file to nested JSON structure
         *  `update.php`: Interface for data update
   *  **img**: image assets
   *  **includes**: templates and HTML assets
      *  `localized_variables.php`: A collection of global variables specific to a municipaltiy.
      *  `imports.php`: CSS and JS assets imports
      *  `datafiles.php`: json datafiles loaded in each instance (AJAX can be used as an alternative)
      *  `home.php`: homescreen html
      *  `navbar.php`: navigation bar html
      *  `templates.php`: contains Mustache templates (eg. table row templates, cards...)
   *  **js**:  Javascript assets
      *  `avb.js`: helper functions and initialization routines
      *  `cards.js`: cards component routines
      *  `chart.js`: chart component routines
      *  `home.js`: homescreen routines and introJs based tutorials code
      *  `statistics.js`: functions used to generate statistical info and number formatting functions
      *  `table.js`: table component routines
      *  `treemap.js`: treemap component routines
* **/src/scss**: SCSS files
   *  `print.scss`:  SCSS applied when printing a Visual Budget page
   *  `global.scss`: main SCSS file (imports all the partials defined below)
   *  **partials**: SCSS assets
      *  `_avb.scss`:  section styles
      *  `_base.scss`: html, body styles, colors and font variables
      *  `_cards.scss`: styles for card component
      *  `_chart.scss`: styles for chart component
      *  `_home.scss`: styles for homescreen
      *  `_navbar.scss`: styles for top navigation bar
      *  `_table.scss`: styles for tabular view
      *  `_treemap.scss`: styles for treemap component

#### Required Libraries
*  Bootstrap (grid layout, dropdowns..)
*  D3 (visualizations)
*  Jquery Cookie
*  DetectMobileBrowser
*  Jquery
*  Mustache (templates)
*  IntroJS (required for tutorials)

## Sample Datasets
Sample `Expenses.json`, `Revenues.json` and `Funds.json` from Arlington, MA in `src/httpdocs/data`.

Budget data is kept in JSON and CSV format. The JSON format is actively used for computation while the CSV format is kept for reference and data download.

#### Data structure

The base data unit is an object with the following fields:

*  `key` {string}: entry name
*  `src` {url string}: link to data source from where entry data was extracted (optional)
*  `hash` {string}: entry id (can be arbitrary)
*  `sub` {array of other entries}: subsections that make up current entry
*  `descr` {string} : entry description (optional)
*  `values` {array of value objects} : entry values over time

A simple value object is defined by:

*  `year` : year of value
*  `val` : value

This data structure could be changed should it be considered not ideal for future uses.

#### Data pipeline
Town representatives are likely to be proficient in editing spreadsheets. The Visual Budget application currently uses a pipeline that converts CSV files (created with Microsoft Excel) to nested JSON files used for computation.

A python script `src/httpdocs/data/processing/processCSV.py` converts a flat CSV file into the nested JSON structure listed above. A php script `src/httpdocs/data/processing/update.php` orchestrates the entire data update procedure.

For more information about CSV data formats or update procedures check `docs/data`.

## Future upgrades
*  Decoupling town related assets (budget sections, links, logos, data..) from core visualization techniques
*  Changing data sections (eg. Replace 'revenues' with 'Town Departments') requires to manually change links (`navbar.php`), homepage data (`home.php`), initialization javascripts (`avb.js`) and update routines (`processCSV.py`, `update.php`). This process should be simplified to allow a simpler migration between different types of data.
*  Grid space. As of now, although each viz component implements a common interface, each visualization is tied to specific div (or html section), the creation of a 'grid' space that allows any visualization to be 'attached' to any area of the screen and would greatly enhance the customization and upgradability of the application.

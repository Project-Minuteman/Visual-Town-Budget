To update revenues, expenses and funds:
* Use the Lexington Brown Book to update `../revenues.csv`, `../expenes.csv`, `../funds.csv`. This is a laborious process as some of the categories changed.
* Run `processAll.sh` from this folder. It will generate `revenues.json`, `expenses.json`, `funds.json`.
* The site is updated with the current year information.

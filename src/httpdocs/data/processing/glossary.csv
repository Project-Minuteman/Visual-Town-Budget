The CPA tax is calculated as a 3% surcharge to property taxes."
Debt Exclusion,"The amount of taxes assessed in excess of the Proposition 2.5 levy limit for the payment of debt service costs, subject to a popular referendum.

Override,An action taken by the voters of the town to exceed the limit placed on tax revenue growth by the State tax limitation law known as Proposition 2.5.

Proposition 2.5,"A tax limitation measure passed by Massachusetts voters in 1980 which limits the growth of the total property tax levy to 2.5% per year. In other words, the total revenue allowed to be raised through real estate and personal property taxes cannot increase by more than 2.5% from one fiscal year to the next. New construction values are in addition to this limit. Two provisions within Proposition 2.5 allow the citizens of a community by popular vote to authorize the Town to raise taxes above the tax levy limit: an operating override or a debt exclusion."

The treasurer shall be custodian of the fund and may invest the proceeds legally; any interest earned shall remain with the fund. Money from the Stabilization Fund may be appropriated for any lawful purpose by two-thirds vote of Town Meeting. In addition to the General Stabilization Fund, the town has stabilization funds for specific purposes, including the Transportation Demand Management Fund, Traffic Mitigation Fund, Special Education Fund, Other Post Employment Benefits (OPEB) Fund, and the Capital Projects/Debt Service/Building Renewal Fund."
Tax Levy,"The total amount to be raised through real estate and personal property taxes. Lexington property owners pay taxes to the Town based on the assessed value of their real and/or personal property. Each year the Board of Selectmen conducts a tax classification hearing to determine a tax rate. The Town Assessor makes adjustments to real estate values in order to properly reflect fair market value. In addition to real estate, businesses may also pay a personal property tax (set at the commercial rate) based on the value of their professional equipment, furniture and fixtures. The amount of taxes a property owner pays is determined by multiplying the applicable tax rate by the valuation. For example, if the tax rate is $10 and a property's assessed value is $100,000, the property owner will pay $10 times $100,000/1,000, or $1,000. Tax levy revenues are the largest source of funding for the Town."
Tax Levy Limit,The maximum amount that can be raised by a municipality within Proposition 2.5.
